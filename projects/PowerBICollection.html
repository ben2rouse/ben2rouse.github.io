      <h2>Assignment Hub Dashboard</h2>
      <p>This dashboard is the final result of a university capstone project I had the privilege of working on with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffrey-filiberto-992177265/">Jeffrey Filiberto</a></p>
      <br>
      <p>This project was aimed at utilizing the OpenAI API to process unstructured school syllabi with the goal of creating a structured assignment database.</p>
      <br>
      <p>This report is the end product on my end of the project, where I visualized the student workload over time to study peak busy times for students in order for on-campus planners to incorporate student workload into their calculations when planning student events.<br></p>
      <br>
      <p>You can read more about the project on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-rouse-7105a924a/#projects">LinkedIn</a> or on the <a href="AssignmentHub.html">Assignment Hub</a> project page on this site.</p>
